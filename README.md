# workshop
This repo contains all the stuff that we're going to use during the workshop.

<!-- We may change this to use a better collaboration tool with our own font etc -->
[Course and excercises PPTX](https://github.com/netbeast/workshop)

## Examples
The `Nodejs-Fundamentals` folder contains the source code of the examples given in the slides.

## Hands-on
 It's organized by levels (1, 2 & 3). 
 
###### Level 1
 Here you'll create a simple plugin that allows you to collect current temperature in London city and 
 share its value in dashboard.
 
###### Level 2
 Now you have a sample app that needs to be completed with some code. Then you could control a virtual bulb
 (or a real one if you have a Lifx or Phillips Hue).
 
###### Level 3
 Additional complexity over previous example.
 
 
 Enjoy it! :+1:
