# Netbeast workshop
# Create IoT apps in Node.js
This repo contains all the stuff that we're going to use during the workshop. Learn about Node.js, Express and MQTT to connect devices. Learn how to run and try out the Netbeast Dashboard.

#### [(40 min) Lecture slides](https://speakerdeck.com/fcojriosbello/meetup-slides)
#### [(2 hours) Workshop slides and excercises](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_7qD6BJzThP8EkmDAavzTQr3bsB3ISEWeQ-Xd6sh0Mo/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

## Examples
The `Nodejs-Fundamentals` folder contains the source code of the examples given in the slides.

## Hands-on
 It's organized by levels (1, 2 & 3).

###### Level 1
 Here you'll create a simple plugin that allows you to collect current temperature in London city and
 share its value in dashboard.

###### Level 2
 Now you have a sample app that needs to be completed with some code. Then you could control a virtual bulb
 (or a real one if you have a Lifx or Phillips Hue).

###### Level 3
 Additional complexity over previous example.


 Enjoy it! :+1:
