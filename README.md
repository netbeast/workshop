# workshop
This repo contains all the stuff that we're going to use during the workshop.

## Examples
The `Nodejs-Fundamentals` folder contains the source code of the examples given in the slides.

## Hands-on
 It's organized by levels (1, 2 & 3).

###### Level 1
 Here you'll create a simple plugin that allows you to collect current temperature in London city and
 share its value in dashboard.

###### Level 2
 Now you have a sample app that needs to be completed with some code. Then you could control a virtual bulb
 (or a real one if you have a Lifx or Phillips Hue).

###### Level 3
 Additional complexity over previous example.


 Enjoy it! :+1:
